Welcome to the ASMX Documentation repository! This repository documents the functionality of the ASMX platform, and includes the decompiled version of the pre-bundled documentation with the assembler. The documentation uses [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), which is a simple and easy to use documentation system. If you're looking to make your first contribution to ASMX, here is a great place to start!

## Quick Start
Clone this repository by either downloading it, or using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/cousdev/asmx-docs.git
cd asmx-docs
```

Make sure you have Python 3.x on your system. Download MKDocs with:

```
pip install mkdocs
```

Then serve the documentation locally with:

```
