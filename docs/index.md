# Welcome to the ASMX Documentation!
This site contains documentation about the ASMX platform.
ASMX is a modular development platform, which consists of:

- **ASMX Assembler** - a macro-enable assembler written in Python
- **ASMX VM** - a custom virtual machine built in Scratch that runs compiled programs

ASMX is designed to be lightweight, extensible, and beginner-friendly. It's perfect for learning about assembly-like languages, macro systems, or virtual machines - especially if you want to create programs or systems in Scratch with a real programming backend.
